# What's EC?

EC is an open-source Discord digital currency bot.
Designed for ease of use and quick deployment in mind, it works as a form of learning to get MySQL to run alongside the Python programming language.

This project aims to demonstrate the oppurtunities MySQL holds through the use of a fun bot that can be deployed and/or modified by anyone at home.

An in depth guide for setup is coming soon!
